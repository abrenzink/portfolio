                <h2>JSON Web Tokens</h2>
                <h3>What is it?</h3>
                <p>JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standardvthat defines a compact and self-contained 
                    way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Compact:</b> Because of its size, it can be sent through an URL, 
                        POST parameter, or inside an HTTP header. Additionally, due to its 
                        size its transmission is fast.</li>
                    <li><b>Self-contained:</b> The payload contains all the required 
                        information about the user, to avoid querying the database more than once.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Clients and Servers</h3>
                <p>The web of computers known as the internet can be separated into 
                    two parts: clients and servers. A client, such as a web browser, 
                    will request a resource (usually a web page) from a server, which 
                    processes the request and sends back a response to the client.
                    JavaScript was originally designed as a client-side scripting 
                    language, meaning that it ran locally in the browser, adding 
                    dynamic features to the web page that was returned from the server.
