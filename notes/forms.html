    <h2>Forms</h2> 
    <br>   
    <p>Forms are a very common <b>method of interacting with a web page</b>. Most of us use forms every
            day to log in to our favorite sites. Forms are made up of a <code> &ltform&gt </code> element 
            that contains form controls such as input fields, select menus and buttons. 
            These input fields can be populated with information that is processed once 
            the form has been submitted. Traditionally, when a form was submitted, it would 
            be sent to a server where the information would be processed using a 'back end' 
            language such as PHP or Ruby. It’s possible to process the information in a 
            form on the 'front end' before it is sent to the server using JavaScript.
            </p>
            <br>
    <p>Each form control has an initial value that can be specified in the HTML code. 
            This value can be changed by a user entering information or interacting with the 
            form’s interface (such as using a slider to increase or decrease a value). The value 
            can also be changed dynamically using JavaScript.</p>
    <br>
    <div class="code">
        <code>&lt!doctype html&gt <br>
            &lthtml lang='en'&gt<br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&lthead&gt<br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&ltmeta charset='utf-8'&gt<br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&lttitle>Search&lt/title&gt<br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&lt/head&gt<br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&ltbody&gt<br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&ltform name='search' action='/search'&gt<br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&ltinput name='searchInput'&gt<br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&ltbutton type='submit'>Search&lt/button&gt<br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&lt/form&gt<br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&ltscript src='main.js'>&lt/script&gt<br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&lt/body&gt<br>
            &lt/html&gt</code>
    </div><br>
    <p>The action attribute is the URL that the form will be submitted to so it can be
            processed on the server side. The input field also has a name attribute of 
            searchInput that is used to access the information inside it.</p>
    <h3>Accessing Form Elements</h3>
    <br>
    <p>The DOM had a useful property called <code>document.forms</code> that returns 
        an HTML collection of all the forms in the document <b>in an array</b> the order they appear 
        in the markup.
    </p>
    <div class="code">
        <code>const form = document.forms[0];<br>
            const form = document.forms.search;<span style="color:rgb(132, 112, 151)">  //referencing 
                by the form's name. Be carefull, however, 
                to not use one of the form's properties name.</span><br>
                const form = document.forms['search'];<span style="color:rgb(132, 112, 151)"> //this way
                is safer.</span></code>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p> A form object also has a method called elements that returns an HTML collection 
        of all the elements contained in the form. In this case the form contains 
        two controls: an input element and a button element:</p>
    <div class="code">
        <code>const [input,button] = form.elements();</code>
    </div><br>
    <h3>Form Properties and Methods</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><code>form.submit()</code> - will submit the form automatically (submitting a 
            form using this method won’t trigger the form submit event).</li>
        <li><code>form.reset()</code> - will reset all the form controls 
            back to their initial values specified in the HTML. (not so good idea).</li>
        <li><code>form.action</code> - property that can be used to set the action 
            attribute of a form, so it’s sent to a different URL to be processed on the server.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Form Events</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><code>focus</code> - occurs when an element is focused on. 
            In the case of an <code>&ltinput&gt</code> element, 
            this is when the cursor is placed inside the element 
            (either by clicking or tapping on it or navigating to it using the keyboard).</li>
        <li><code>blur</code> - occurs when the user moves the focus away from the form element.</li>
        <li><code>change</code> - occurs when the user moves the focus away from the form
                element after changing it. So if a user clicks in an input field 
                and makes no changes, and then clicks elsewhere, the <code>change</code> event won’t fire, 
                but the <code>blur</code> event will.</li>
        <li><code>submit</code> - the most important form event is the submit event, 
            occurring when the form is submitted. Usually this will send the content 
            of the form to the server to be processed, but we can use JavaScript to intercept
                the form before it’s sent by adding a <code>submit</code> event listener.
            <div class="code" style="max-width: 400px">
            <code>const form = document.forms['search'];<br>
                form.addEventListener ('submit', search, false);<br>
                <br>
                function search() {<br>
                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspalert(' Form Submitted');<br>
                }<br></code>
            </div><br>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Form Controls</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><code>&ltinput&gt</code> - fields, including text, passwords, check boxes, 
            radio buttons, and file uploads. There are many types of them.</li>
        <li><code>&ltselect&gt</code> - menus for drop-down lists of options</li>
        <li><code>&lttextarea&gt</code> - elements for longer text entry</li>
        <li><code>&ltbutton&gt</code> - elements for submitting and resetting forms</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Input Attributes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><code>input.autofocus</code> - give focus to this element when a page loads.</li>
        <li><code>input.placeholder</code> - will insert the value provided in the input field until the user enters some text.</li>
        <li><code>input.maxlenght</code> - attribute will limit the number of characters that can be entered in the field to the value given.</li>
        <li><code>&ltbutton&gt</code> - elements for submitting and resetting forms</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Input Fields</h3>
    <p>The initial value of this field can be set in the HTML using the value attribute.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Text input fields - used for entering a short piece of text, such as a username. </li>
        <li>Password input fields - used to enter passwords or secret information. </li>
        <li>Checkbox input fields - used to select different options that can be checked 
            (true) or left unchecked (false). The user can select more than one checkbox from a list. </li>
        <li>Radio button input fields - allow users to check an option as true, 
            but they provide an exclusive choice of options, so only one option can be selected. </li>
        <li>Hidden input fields - are not displayed by the browser, but have a 'value' 
            attribute that can contain information that is submitted with the form. 
            They are often used to send information such as settings or information 
            that the user has already provided. </li>
        <li>File input fields - used to upload files, and most browsers will provide a browse
                button or similar that lets users select a file from their file system. </li>
        <li>Other input fields - such as number, tel and color. As browsers start to support these, 
            they will implement different user-interface elements depending on the input type. 
            They will also validate automatically, so an email input field will show an error 
            message if there’s no valid email address. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Form Validation</h3>
    <p>The process of checking whether a user has entered the information into a form correctly.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A required field is completed</li>
        <li>An email address is valid</li>
        <li>A number is entered when numerical data is required</li>
        <li>A password is at least a minimum number of characters</li>
    </ul><br>
    <p>It’s possible for a user to modify the JavaScript code and bypass the 
        validation rules. It's also very easy to bypass the front-end completely 
        and send arbitrary data to the application's backend. For these reasons, 
        JavaScript validation should be used to enhance the user experience when 
        filling in a form by giving feedback about any errors before it’s submitted.</p>
