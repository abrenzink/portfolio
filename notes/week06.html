                <h2>Week 06 - Forms</h2> 
                <br>   
                <p>Forms are a very common <b>method of interacting with a web page</b>. Most of us use forms every
                     day to log in to our favorite sites. Forms are made up of a <code> &ltform&gt </code> element 
                     that contains form controls such as input fields, select menus and buttons. 
                     These input fields can be populated with information that is processed once 
                     the form has been submitted. Traditionally, when a form was submitted, it would 
                     be sent to a server where the information would be processed using a 'back end' 
                     language such as PHP or Ruby. Itâ€™s possible to process the information in a 
                     form on the 'front end' before it is sent to the server using JavaScript.
                     </p>
                     <br>
                <p>Each form control has an initial value that can be specified in the HTML code. 
                     This value can be changed by a user entering information or interacting with the 
                     formâ€™s interface (such as using a slider to increase or decrease a value). The value 
                     can also be changed dynamically using JavaScript.</p>
                <br>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>&lt!doctype html&gt <br>
                        &lthtml lang='en'&gt<br>
                        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&lthead&gt<br>
                        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&ltmeta charset='utf-8'&gt<br>
                        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&lttitle>Search&lt/title&gt<br>
                        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&lt/head&gt<br>
                        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&ltbody&gt<br>
                        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&ltform name='search' action='/search'&gt<br>
                        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&ltinput name='searchInput'&gt<br>
                        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&ltbutton type='submit'>Search&lt/button&gt<br>
                        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&lt/form&gt<br>
                        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&ltscript src='main.js'>&lt/script&gt<br>
                        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&lt/body&gt<br>
                        &lt/html&gt</code>
                </div><br>
                <p>The action attribute is the URL that the form will be submitted to so it can be
                     processed on the server side. The input field also has a name attribute of 
                      searchInput that is used to access the information inside it.</p>
                <h3>Accessing Form Elements</h3>
                <br>
                <p>The DOM had a useful property called <code>document.forms</code> that returns 
                    an HTML collection of all the forms in the document <b>in an array</b> the order they appear 
                    in the markup.
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>const form = document.forms[0];<br>
                        const form = document.forms.search;<span style="color:rgb(132, 112, 151)">  //referencing 
                            by the form's name. Be carefull, however, 
                            to not use one of the form's properties name.</span><br>
                            const form = document.forms['search'];<span style="color:rgb(132, 112, 151)"> //this way
                            is safer.</span></code>
                </div>
                <br>
                <p> A form object also has a method called elements that returns an HTML collection 
                    of all the elements contained in the form. In this case the form contains 
                    two controls: an input element and a button element:</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>const [input,button] = form.elements();</code>
                </div><br>
                <h3>Form Properties and Methods</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>form.submit()</code> - will submit the form automatically (submitting a 
                        form using this method wonâ€™t trigger the form submit event).</li>
                    <li><code>form.reset()</code> - will reset all the form controls 
                        back to their initial values specified in the HTML. (not so good idea).</li>
                    <li><code>form.action</code> - property that can be used to set the action 
                        attribute of a form, so itâ€™s sent to a different URL to be processed on the server.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Form Events</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>focus</code> - occurs when an element is focused on. 
                        In the case of an <code>&ltinput&gt</code> element, 
                        this is when the cursor is placed inside the element 
                        (either by clicking or tapping on it or navigating to it using the keyboard).</li>
                    <li><code>blur</code> - occurs when the user moves the focus away from the form element.</li>
                    <li><code>change</code> - occurs when the user moves the focus away from the form
                         element after changing it. So if a user clicks in an input field 
                         and makes no changes, and then clicks elsewhere, the <code>change</code> event wonâ€™t fire, 
                         but the <code>blur</code> event will.</li>
                    <li><code>submit</code> - the most important form event is the submit event, 
                        occurring when the form is submitted. Usually this will send the content 
                        of the form to the server to be processed, but we can use JavaScript to intercept
                         the form before itâ€™s sent by adding a <code>submit</code> event listener.
                        <div class="code" style="max-width: 400px">
                        <code>const form = document.forms['search'];<br>
                            form.addEventListener ('submit', search, false);<br>
                            <br>
                            function search() {<br>
                                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspalert(' Form Submitted');<br>
                            }<br></code>
                        </div><br>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Form Controls</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>&ltinput&gt</code> - fields, including text, passwords, check boxes, radio buttons, and file uploads</li>
                    <li><code>&ltselect&gt</code> - wmenus for drop-down lists of options</li>
                    <li><code>&lttextarea&gt</code> - elements for longer text entry</li>
                    <li><code>&ltbutton&gt</code> - elements for submitting and resetting forms</li>
                </ul>
