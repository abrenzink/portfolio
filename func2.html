                <h2>Functions, Execution Context and the Call Stack</h2>
                <h3>What does the computer do?</h3><br>
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/exrc_rLj5iw?start=128

                <p>There are two mains thing the computer does when it runs a code:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Store stuff in the memory</li>
                    <li>Saves a "path" to each part of the memory that will be storing info.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Synchronous execution</h3>
                <p>When we go through the code line by line we go through it in order from top to bottom
                    of our page and I never skip a line that means it is synchronous. Single threaded 
                    means <b>one thing at a time.</b> I am not starting to execute a function
                    and continuing to do that while simultaneously continuing down the rest of a 
                    code at the same time. If I call a function my thread is not continuing
                    down the code.</p>
                <h3>Functions</h3>
                <p>Functions are a way of wrapping up some instructions to be
                    done later on. We give them a label. That saves us
                    having to write all that code out again. So we just wrap it up 
                    and give it a label, and then we refer to it later.</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>function multiplyBy2(num){<br>
                        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspconst result = num * 2;<br>
                        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspreturn result; <br>
                        }<br></code>
                </div>
                <p>Remember the <b>parenthesis.</b> is the symbol that indicates there is some
                work to be done, so that the computar knows it should look for a function
                with the specific name and run any code stored in it. While executing lines inside
                the function, the variable to store the result is <b>undefined.</b></p>
