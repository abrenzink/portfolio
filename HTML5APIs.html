                <h2>HTML5 APIs</h2>
                <h3>The data- Attribute</h3>
                <p>The <b>data-</b> attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using 
                    custom attributes that are ignored by the browser. Those attricutes are private to 
                    a page, so are not intended to be used by an external service. Their only purpose is to 
                    be used by a JavaScript program. This means theyâ€™re perfect for adding data that 
                    can be used to access information about a particular element on the page.</p><br>
                <p>The names of these attributes can be decided by the developer, but they must use the following format:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start with data-.</li>
                    <li>Contain only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, colons or underscores.</li>
                    <li>Include an optional string value.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>data-powers = 'flight superSpeed'<br>
                        data-rating = '5' <br>
                        data-dropdown <br>
                        data-user = 'DAZ' <br>
                        data-max-length = '32'<br></code>
                </div><br>
                <p>The information contained in the attributes can be used to identify particular elements. 
                    The values of the attributes can also be used to filter different elements.
                     For example, we could find all the elements that have a data-rating value of 3 or more.</p><br>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>&ltdiv id='hero' data-powers='flight superSpeed'&gt<br>
                        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSuperman<br>
                        &lt/div&gt<br></code>
                </div><br>
                <p>The data-powers attribute can be accessed using the following code:</p><br>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>const superman = document.getElementById('hero');<br>
                        const powers = superman.dataset.powers;<br>
                        &lt&lt 'flight superSpeed'<br></code>
                </div><br>
                <p><b>Remember the data- prefix is dropped!!!</b> To access the attribute, if a data- attributeâ€™s name contains hyphens, 
                    they are replaced with camel-case notation, so <b>data-max-length</b> would be accessed using <b>dataset.maxLength.</b></p>
                    
                <h3>HTML5 Web Storage</h3>
                <p>The Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the clientâ€™s computer that is similar to using cookies but 
                    has fewer restrictions, more storage capacity, and is generally easier to use. This makes it perfect for 
                    <b>storing information about users and application-specific information to be used during future sessions.</b></p><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Information stored is not shared with the server on every request.</li>
                    <li>Information is available in multiple windows of the browser (if the domain is the same).</li>
                    <li>Storage capacity limit is much larger. Most browsers have a limit set at 5GB per domain.</li>
                    <li>Any data stored does not automatically expire as it does with cookies.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>If a browser supports the Web Storage API, the window object will have a property called localStorage, 
                    which is a native object with a number of properties and methods used to store data. The information 
                    is saved in the form of key-value pairs, and the values can only be strings. There is also a sessionStorage object 
                    that works in the same way, although the data is only saved for the current session.</p><br>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>localStorage.setItem('name', 'Walter White');<br><br>
                        localStorage.getItem('name');       <span class="coment">// use of methods to store information</span><br>
                        &lt&lt "Walter White"<br><br>
                        localStorage.name = 'Heisenberg'; <span class="coment">// using assignment instead of methods</span><br><br>
                        console.log(localStorage.name); <br>
                        &lt&lt "Heisenberg";<br>
                    </code>
                </div><br>
                    
            
            </div>
